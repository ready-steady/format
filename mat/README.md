# MATLAB MAT

The package provides an adapter to the
[MATLAB MAT-file API](http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/matlab/apiext.pdf).

## Installation

Run:

```bash
$ go get github.com/go-math/format/mat
```

The above command will fail. However, it will properly clone this repository
into [`$GOPATH`](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). Go to that
directory:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/go-math/format/mat
```

Set the `MATLAB_ROOT` and `MATLAB_ARCH` environment variables according to your
MATLAB installation. It is preferable to do so in `~/.bash_profile` or alike.
For example:

```bash
export MATLAB_ROOT=/Applications/MATLAB_R2014a.app
export MATLAB_ARCH=maci64
```

Update the environment and run:

```bash
$ make install
```

In order to run an executable that relies on this package, the dynamic linker
should be able to discover MATLABâ€™s libraries. To this end, an appropriate
environment variable should be set depending on your system. For example, in
`.bash_profile`:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MATLAB_ROOT/bin/$MATLAB_ARCH:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
