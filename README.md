# MATLAB MAT

The package provides an adapter to the [MATLAB MAT-file API][1].

## [Documentation][doc]

## Installation

Fetch the package:

```bash
go get -d github.com/ready-steady/mat
```

Go to the directory of the package:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ready-steady/mat
```

Set the `MATLAB_ROOT` and `MATLAB_ARCH` environment variables according to your
MATLAB installation. For example,

```bash
export MATLAB_ROOT=/Applications/MATLAB_R2015a.app
export MATLAB_ARCH=maci64
```

Finally, install the package:

```bash
make install
```

In order to run an executable that relies on this package, the dynamic linker
should be able to discover MATLABâ€™s libraries. To this end, an appropriate
environment variable should be set depending on your system. For example,

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MATLAB_ROOT/bin/$MATLAB_ARCH:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
